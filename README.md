# Arduino_I2C-TWI-RTL-Master_Slave_Project
Application of the I2C Ibus protocol of communication to deploy an arduino project that manipulates the smb bus with serial port communication to PC. This project can be described as a extension interface of one existing personal project in arduino named "javaFx_arduinoIntegration" , I use two arduino uno boards to apply the configuration of master and slave real time logic. Additionally to this I use one of my personal library to manipulate the seven segments x 4 LED. Enjoy! @By ChecheSwap -Jesús José Navarrete Baca
